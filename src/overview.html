  This is the API specification for version 1.0 of the jCobolLexer.
  <h3>Description</h3>
  jCobolLexer is a Cobol 85 X3.23-1985 lexer written in Java and distributed
  as a .jar library for use in other applications.
  <h3>Use</h3>
  You have a Cobol source program (<code>program.cbl</code>) you want to parse:
  <pre><code>
            Reader reader = new FileReader("program.cbl");
            CobolLexer cardReader = new CobolLexer(reader);
            TokenList tokens = cardReader.getTokens();
      </code></pre>
  The <code>tokens</code> object contains the entire source program parsed as a
  list of <code>CobolToken</code> objects.
  <p>A <code>CobolToken</code> object gives you:
  <ul>
      <li>The token's starting position (line and column).
      <li>The token's content found at that position.
      <li>The token's type (string, word, separator, etc).
  </ul>
  <h3>Source text manipulation</h3>
  <p>Lexer doesn't do source text manipulation (COPY/REPLACE). This is by design:
      lexer just give you the original token in the given source file.
  <p>If you want to do text maniplation, see de jCobolCopy project: it process
      the jCobolLexer output to do that process.
